- question: "What do I need to know to use Nova?"
  answer: >
    Nova makes building apps easier, but it does require some knowledge of 
    the Node and React ecosystems. You should also be comfortable with using the command line
    and Git. In other words, it's aimed at intermediate-level developers.
- question: "What can I build with Nova?"
  answer: >
    The best use case for Nova is any type of app organized around 
    a feed or database of user-generated content. Think Instagram, Product Hunt, or even AirBnB. 
    That being said you can also use Nova's various modules to help build anything at all if 
    you know Meteor and React. 
- question: "How much does Nova cost to deploy?"
  answer: >
    You should budget around $10/month for a Digital Ocean droplet, 
    plus $20/month for MongoDB database hosting. Note that Nova *cannot* be
    hosted on shared hosting.

        Here are a few ways you can help with Telescope:

        ### Share The Word

        Telling other people about Telescope is the easiest way to help the project. For example, a [tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Ftelesc.pe%2F&text=Telescope: an open-source @meteorjs app that lets anybody build their own Hacker News&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftelesc.pe%2F&via=Telescpe) is always appreciated.

        ### Bugs and Support

        If you have a little bit more time, you can also head over to [Meta.Telesc.pe](http://meta.telesc.pe), Telescope's internal discussion group, to see if anybody has questions or is in need of help over there. 

        And if you're really feeling generous, you can take a look at Telescope's [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues) and see if you can take care of a couple of them.

        ### Improve the Telescope Documentation

        The Telescope site (the one you're on right now) is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/telescope-homepage/). If you'd like to [contribute to the documentation](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/telescope-homepage/tree/master/source/docs) to fix a typo, clarify a point, or even add a section, pull requests are more than welcome!

        ### Security Fixes

        If you stumble upon a security issue, please [get in touch directly](mailto:hello@telesc.pe) instead of disclosing it publicly. 

        ---

        ### Contributing New Features

        And finally, since Telescope is open-source you can of course also contribute code to the project directly. Just [check out the roadmap](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/blob/master/Roadmap.md), and then [drop me an email](mailto:hello@telesc.pe) to let me know what you'd like to work on.

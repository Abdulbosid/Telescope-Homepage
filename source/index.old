  %h2 So What's Meteor?
  %p.first <a href="http://meteor.com" target="_blank">Meteor</a> is at the forefront of a new wave of frameworks that make building web apps <em>easier</em>, <em>simpler</em>, and <em>faster</em>. 
  %p Not only is Meteor <strong>entirely real-time</strong> (meaning any change to your database is automatically reflected live in the browser), but the fact that <strong>it uses JavaScript on both the client and server</strong> means that you won't have to juggle with multiple languages and environments anymore. 
  %p No matter your programming experience, by following our step-by-step instructions you'll be able to get your own Meteor app up and running in a matter of days!

### Should You Update?

As I said, this update contains a few breaking, non-backwards compatible changes. So before updating with `meteor update` or by pulling from [the Telescope repo](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope), please read through the whole changelog and make sure the update won't break any critical features in your app!

### Meteor 1.2

Telescope now runs on Meteor 1.2. The main consequence is that the new version might be **incompatible with packages and themes** that haven't been updated yet.

As far as themes and packages are concerned, the main incompatible change is that static assets (such as images) are not included in packages via `addFile` anymore, but via `addAssets` instead. You'll find a [full list of Meteor 1.2 changes here](https://quip.com/RXFlAk9Rc2xI).

### FlowRouter

The other big change is the switch from [Iron Router](https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router) to [FlowRouter](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router).

In order to make the migration quicker, I decided to simplify Telescope's routing architecture by **getting rid of the `/top`, `/best`, `/new`, etc. views**. Don't worry, the various views are still available, but they're now driven by URL query parameters (`?view=top`) instead of separate routes. 

If this turns out to be an issue for existing apps, I will accept PRs to add route aliases for these views. 

So why switch in the first place? Despite both being advertised as “routers”, Iron Router and FlowRouter do very different things. While Iron Router also handled subscription and data management, FlowRouter focuses on routing exclusively. 

This means pushing out a lot of logic into different parts of your app (namely, [template controllers](https://www.discovermeteor.com/blog/meteor-components-template-controller-pattern/)) and, in a way, taking a step back towards a less organized codebase. But in practice, it's also a lot easier to manage. As it turns out, it's just best to spread complexity around rather than try and do to much in one place. 

### Filtering

Finally, from a features standpoint the big improvement is **filtering**. Each Telescope parameter (post view, category, search query, etc.) can now be combined simultaneously. This means you can now search within a category, rank these search results by score or date posted, and even (although it's not exposed yet in the UI) limit the results to a specific time period. 

Used in combination with category filtering, this means you can now use Telescope as a powerful directory or search engine for large amounts of content. 

### Spiderable

Some people have reported issues with Meteor's own Spiderable rendering package, used to render a copy of the sites for bots and crawlers. So I've extracted the dependency out to is own `telescope:spiderable` package to make it easier to remove it. 

This means that if you're upgrading from an older version of Telescope and want to keep using Spiderable, you'll need to **add `telescope:spiderable` to your list of packages** with `meteor add telescope:spiderable`.

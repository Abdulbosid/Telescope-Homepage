So you've installed Telescope, customized your app, and deployed your new instance. But now what?

Setting up Telescope is easy, but actually building a successful, thriving online community is not. Especially since these days, you have to compete with Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and countless others social networks for people's time and attention.

It's hard, but not impossible if you know the right techniques. So in this guide, we'll examine some of the strategies that were behind the success of massively popular sites such as Dribbble, Product Hunt, and Reddit.

### Defining A Target

You don't want to have to suddenly announce to the 5000 members of your weightlifting community that it will be refocusing on ice skating moving forward. So you'd better make sure you have the right target before you launch. 

When trying to narrow down your audience, you'll want to look for at least two of the following characteristics:

#### Well-defined

In this case, the larger the target, the harder it will be to hit. It'll be hard to foster an active and passionate community if you launch yet another site about “tech”. But if you pick a specific framework or programming language, you're already dramatically increasing your chances of seducing at least a few die-hard fans. 

#### Reachable

It also helps to pick an audience that's already well-connected and easy to reach. It's going to be hard building a social network for fishermen if your audience spends half its time away at sea without Internet access. 

And “people who hate avocado” might be a well-defined market, but there are no existing places where you can easily reach all avocado haters, making it harder to acquire members. 

#### Passionate

And finally, it always helps to find a topic your audience truly cares about. Either pick something people truly love (like the Twilight saga) or really hate (like the Twilight saga), just don't choose something that leaves your audience indifferent. 

As an example, many popular tech blogs have a massive audience, but their engagement in terms of comments is actually pretty low. The truth is that after the 30th “world-changing” new startup of the day, it's hard to care one way or the other. 

#### Growing

Picking the right wave to right is an art in itself, but if you can do it you'll be well on your way to having a successful site. 

After all, when it comes to communities, network effects matter a lot. So if you can be the first to address a specific domain, that alone might be enough to tip the scales in your favor. 

I saw this with the success of [Discover Meteor](http://discovermeteor.com), a book about the [Meteor](http://meteor.com) JavaScript framework that I co-authored. By being the first book to target a new platform, we were able to not only capture the lead (and keep it even as competing books launched), but also benefit from Meteor's own meteoric (pun intended) growth.

**Homework**

- Say something controversial about your topic of choice on Twitter. See if people actually care or not. 
- Use Google Trends to get an idea of how fast your audience is currently growing. 

### Inviting New Members

The first thing to realize is the importance of doing – as Paul Graham puts it – [things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html), especially the early stages of your site.

What I mean by that is that the Facebook team obviously doesn't invite every new user individually. But you might have to do just that to kickstart your community. 

When launching [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/), Ryan Hoover personally invited dozens, if not hundreds of users. And that was after already doing the exact same thing for the now-defunct [Startup Edition](https://twitter.com/startupedition). 

So don't be shy about inviting people one by one, and even specifically asking them to leave a comment, post a link, or submit a question. 

Start with your closest friends, and progressively work your way up to prominent figures in your field. 

For example, you could: 

1. Ask Friend A to post a link to an article.
2. Leave a comment on that article.
3. Ask Friend B to leave a comment as well.
4. Tell the article's author about the discussion, and invite them to contribute.

Sure, it took three emails, but in return you just created three happy users:

- Friend A is happy that his submission generated a discussion.
- Friend B is happy because Author X replied to their comment.
- Author X is happy because people are sharing and commenting on their work. 

And of course, you're happy because your site is taking off!

### Telescope Tip: Assigning Authors

Telescope lets admins assign a post to any user. 

So assuming Author X has created an account on your site but is too busy to contribute, you could post a link to their content yourself and then assign it to their profile.

<% end %>

**Homework**

- Invite 10 friends and 10 “celebrities” in your field to your new community.

### Finding More Users

Of course, you inviting every single user one by one will quickly get tiring. So another good method is reaching out to *another* community to seed yours. 

Now while you could just try and poach a competing community's members, I believe the best approach is to instead target a *complementary* community.

So if you're launching a forum about gardening, don't try to approach *another* gardening forum. Instead, reach out to gardening *chatrooms*, *blogs*, or *mailing lists*. 

Try to create two-way relationships between you and these other channels. They talk about you, and you in turn will promote their content to your members. 

**Homework**

- Reach out to 5 new complementary channels and tell them about your community. 

### Seeding Content

Nobody wants to be the first to leave a party. But you know that as soon as one person makes a move for their coat, pretty soon the whole place will end up empty. 

Similarly, users don't like to be the first to submit a link, ask a question, or post a comment. This is why it's very important that you **seed** your community with the type of content you'd like to see. 

Want people to post links? Start by posting links yourself. Want people to ask questions? Ask some yourself. Want people to leave comments? You get the idea.

Of course, after a while people will realize that you're posting every post, link, and comment yourself, and they'll be happy to leave it all up to you since you seem to be doing *such* a good job. 

To combat this, remember to regularly ask your friends to participate, or even create a few extra accounts for yourself (as [Reddit's founders famously did](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-reddit-got-huge-tons-of-fake-accounts--2)).

### Engaging Your Community

Let's suppose you've managed to round up a few dozens smart people, who each have posted on your site a few times. Now all that's left is to lay back and watch the magic happen, right?

Wrong! If you stop here, you'll pretty soon see traffic and engagement slide back down to zero, as people's busy lives take over and they forget to visit your site. 

This is why it's very important to **engage** your community. And the easiest way to do this is to get people to **ask questions**. 

Simple questions can result in extremely popular threads with dozens or hundreds of replies. Examples include:

- What are you working on?
- How would you improve this community?
- Who would you like us to invite here?
- Can you introduce yourself?

And of course, the ultimate question thread is the “AMA”, for “Ask Me Anything”, where you get a well-known personality to answer your members' questions. 

Not only is this a fantastic way to generate engagement, it's also usually quite fun (not to mention a nice ego boost) for the person doing the answering, too. 

### Reaching Your Audience

The worst mistake you can make is building an audience without having any way to actually *reach* it. You might be the top post on Hacker News today, but unless you can build some sort of connection with your newly-gained audience you'll be back to obscurity tomorrow. 

The most reliable way to build this connection is also the simplest: **email**. 

This is why Telescope includes an [email digest](http://localhost:8000/docs/packages/newsletter/) that automatically gets generated from your site's top content.

Notifications are another way to keep members coming back. Let them know when someone has upvoted their link, commented on their post, or interacted with them in any other way.

### Telescope Tip: More Than Link Digests

Telescope integrates with [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/). So while you can of course use Telescope's generated email newsletters, you're by no means limited to them. You can take advantage of all of MailChimp's features to send any kind of emails to your community's list. 

For example, [Bootstrappers.io](http://bootstrappers.io) sends its list custom email announcements for [upcoming AMAs](http://us9.campaign-archive1.com/?u=80d2ecfdc1dcd9bf5118c3b36&id=00be906127&e=678d5d3803).

### Reusing Your Content

Just like Native Americans used every part of the buffalo (even the nose? what the hell are you supposed to do with a buffalo nose?!), you too should aim to use every part of your community. 

To pick a concrete example, let's say you've just held an AMA with some famous expert, and managed to generate a decent amount of content. Don't move on just yet!

Why not write a blog post compiling the best questions and answers? Or even package together some kind of eBook you can give out when people sign up for your community?

And even without special content, your community itself can be a source of news and data. You can blog about the most popular domains, talk about traffic stats, or publish monthly user rankings. 

Product Hunt employs this “recycling” mechanic perfectly: their “Collections” feature lets members create their own lists of products organized around a theme: this not only gives members a sense of ownership and engagement with the site, but it's also a great way to help resurface older content for new members. 






### Promoting Your Community

When it comes to marketing, the two most common mistakes are not doing enough of it, and doing *too much* of it. 

You definitely don't want to limit yourself to the “build it and they will come” strategy and passively wait for people to discover your site. 

But you *also* don't want to start telling the world before your community is ready. And at launch, it almost certainly won't be. After all, what makes for a compelling community is, well, its *community*, and at this point it's barely getting started. You don't want to call in the food critics to review your restaurant while it's still three-quarters empty. 

Then again, you also don't want to wait *too* long, lest your brand new community becomes old news. So somewhere in between is the big launch sweet spot, and it's up to you to find it.



### Making Your Community Exclusive

It's the oldest trick in the book: limit supply to drive up demand. If it works for diamonds, maybe it can work for you?

But making a community invite-only can be a double-edged sword: on one hand it will make it seem more appealing, but on the other hand you might miss out on key users. 

This is why it's probably a good idea to make the barrier somewhat flexible: limit access to the site, but give out invites if people ask you on Twitter.

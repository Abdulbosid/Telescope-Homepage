You've probably heard about the recent Reddit drama: a slew of unpopular decisions by Reddit management led to some major subreddits temporarily shutting down in protest, and many users voiced their intention to abandon the site.

This in turn created a renewed interest around Reddit alternatives, as shown by this now-famous Google Trends graph:

Some of the more popular options, like [Voat](https://voat.co/) or [Snapzu](http://snapzu.com/) are homespun, original codebases. But not everybody has the necessary coding skills to create a Reddit-site like from scratch. 

### Reddit vs Telescope

So if you too want to launch your own Reddit alternative, you have a couple options. You could use Reddit's [own codebase](https://github.com/reddit/reddit), since it's free and open-source. 

Or you could use **Telescope**. It's also a free, open-source Reddit-style app, but it sports a few key differences with Reddit. 

So in this post, I'll walk you through a couple key questions to help you understand these differences, and pick the app that's best for your own needs. 

### Which Operating System Do You Run?

Reddit features a helpful [install script](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/reddit-install-script-for-Ubuntu), but that install script is designed for Ubuntu, not Mac OS or Windows. 

The [full install instructions](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/Install-guide) on the other hand are pretty daunting, with multiple steps and separate components. 

Telescope's [install process](http://docs.telescopeapp.org/docs/installing-telescope) is a little easier and, crucially, works equally well on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. 

So if you're running Windows or Mac OS, Telescope will probably be a lot easier to set up locally. 

### How Comfortable Are You With Server Administration?

Even Reddit's install script will require a basic level of familiarity with Ubuntu and sysadmins stuff. If sentences like “the easiest thing is probably editing /etc/hosts on the host machine” make no sense to you, you might get stuck if you happen to run into any issues. 

Telescope does also require you to use the command line for basic operations such as set up, update, and deployment, but it's a little bit more user-friendly. 

Thanks to tools like [Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up), you should be able to do every operation remotely with simple command entered from your local machine, without having to actually log in to your server.

### Do You Need Subreddits?

Reddit's key selling point is its subreddit feature: unlike traditional message boards with their predefined categories, Reddit lets anybody create, customize, and moderate their own sub-forum.

While Telescope supports categories, it doesn't have something as powerful and flexible as subreddits. So if that's a key requirement, Reddit will be better suited to your needs. 

### Do You Need Themes And Plug-ins?

While Reddit is popular and open-source, it's not a *popular open-source app*. In other words, it lacks the ecosystem and community that has developed around apps like WordPress or Drupal. 

As Redditor [crimson117 put it](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/1uyxre/why_dont_we_see_more_websites_using_reddit_code/):

> Reddit is difficult to deploy. It's mostly open source, but it's not designed to be widely distributed and easy to install, especially when compared to, say, PHPBB. 

While Telescope isn't *quite* at WordPress-level popularity just yet, it does have a growing [collection of themes](/themes) you can use for free, with more on the way. 

### Do You Need Advanced Moderation Tools?

Reddit has been around for a while, and it has had time to develop an array of moderation features. 

As a younger project, Telescope doesn't support as many tools just yet. 

### Conclusion

Reddit is an older, stabler project with a decade-long track record, but it's also a bit less welcoming and harder to get into. 

Telescope is a fresher, more experimental codebase that's just getting started, with an active community but also some of the growing pains that come with younger projects.

Both have their pros and cons, and hopefully this article will help you choose the one that's best for you!

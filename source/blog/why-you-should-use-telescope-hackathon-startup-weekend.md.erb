Telescope bills itself as “the easiest way to create your own Product Hunt or Hacker News”, but did you know it can also do a lot more than that?

### A Real Community Platform

Although WordPress was first conceived as a blogging platforms, it now powers everything from portfolios to e-commerce. And just like WordPress, Telescope hides a lot of power under the hood. 

In fact, Telescope is actually a full-blown community platform: if users can connect to it and submit content, you can probably build it with Telescope.

### Flexible & Extensible

What makes Telescope how powerful as a community platform is how flexible it is. Instead of trying to give you every possible feature under the sun out of the box, Telescope has a lightweight core but is very easy to extend and customize. 

For example, with just a few lines of code you can add [custom fields](http://docs.telescopeapp.org/v0.20/docs/custom-fields) to Telescope's posts, users, or comments, and Telescope will automatically take care of adding them to the user interface, validating their content, and saving it to the database.

You can also target any fragment of the user interface and [replace it](http://docs.telescopeapp.org/v0.20/docs/custom-templates) with your own code. No need to overhaul the whole theme (unless you want to, of course!), you can just pick and chose what you need. 

### Telescope & Hackathons

Which brings me to my main point: **Telescope is perfect for short sprints like hackathons or Startup Weekends**. 

When you only half 48 hours or less to create something out of thin air, it doesn't make sense to waste half of that building your own user accounts logic or commenting system. 

Shouldn't you be focusing your efforts on the things that will make your project truly stand out, not on what it has in common with every other web app already out there?

This is exactly what Telescope lets you do. If you think about it, a big proportion of startup and app ideas can be boiled down to “users sharing content and other users reacting to it”. And that's exactly where Telescope shines. 

### Powered By Meteor

The fact that Telescope runs on top of [Meteor](http://meteor.com) is also a major advantage. Right out of the box, Meteor includes quite a few features that help you go faster:

- Live reload and CSS concatenation.
- Free and easy deploy to *.meteor.com.
- Uses JavaScript, the most common language on the web.
- Real-time and reactive by default.

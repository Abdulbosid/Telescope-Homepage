### Telescope Base Theme

The main improvement in this update is that part of the Hubble theme's styles have now been split into their own theme, `telescope-theme-base`. 

The base theme contains all the boring stuff that you probably won't want to duplicate: the mobile navigation, forms, and basic styles for tables and other common elements. 

You can use it as a skeleton to build your own themes. To do so, simply remove the Hubble theme with `mrt remove telescope-theme-hubble`, create your own theme, and start styling!

Of course, you're also free to get rid of the base theme as well if you prefer customizing Telescope completely from scratch. 

If you're curious, this is what the base theme looks like:

### Accounts Entry

I also finally got rid of the ugly default account popup and replaced it with the [accounts-entry](https://github.com/Differential/accounts-entry/) package. 

### Tracking Votes

Finally, Telescope now tracks your upvotes and downvotes and displays your upvotes on your user profile page. 

### What's Next

Don't forget to check out the [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/oLMMqjVL/telescope-roadmap) to see what's next for Telescope. I could definitely use some extra help, so if you think you could pitch in don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:hello@telesc.pe)!

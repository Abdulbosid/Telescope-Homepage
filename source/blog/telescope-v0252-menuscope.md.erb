Telescope's menu component now has its own package. 

READMORE

In this latest release, a lot of work went into extracting Telescope's menu component into its own, [independent package](https://github.com/meteor-utilities/menu). 

This means you can now easily reuse it in your own Meteor apps, and it's all part of making Telescope more modular, and more community-driven.

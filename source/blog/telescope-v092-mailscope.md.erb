The latest version of Telescope brings a lot of improvements, mostly on the email side. 

READMORE

### Better Emails

The main improvement is a new email templating system that automatically styles your app's emails with your colors and branding.

 You can read more about it in the new [Sending Emails](/docs/sending-email/) section in the docs. 

### Newsletter Package

Thanks to this new email system, I was also able to implement a system for [automatically sending out newsletter digests](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope-Newsletter).

The package is included by default with Telescope, but you can find its code and instructions (as well as submit issues) [on GitHub](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope-Newsletter).

### New Documentation Sections

As mentioned, there's a new [Sending Emails](/docs/sending-email/) section in the docs, and I've also added a section about [Telescope Packages](/docs/packages).

### Updating

When updating, you might need to manually remove the older `mailchimp` package and install it again, since it has been replaced with the [meteor-mailchimp](https://github.com/MiroHibler/meteor-mailchimp) Atmosphere smart package of the same name. 

So just do `mrt remove mailchimp`, manually delete the directory, then run `mrt add mailchimp`.

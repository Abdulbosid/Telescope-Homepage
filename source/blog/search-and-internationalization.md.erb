I'd like to talk about two new features that got recently added to Telescope, both of them the result of outside contributions.

### Search

First off, I was able to implement search with [Ry Walker](https://github.com/ryw)'s help. This is a long-awaited and very useful feature, so I'm very happy to finally be able to take it off the list.

It's not perfect though, as the search uses regular expressions instead of the more robust native search now supported by MongoDB. 

Native search is not enabled in all MongoDB databases, and requires a few obscure Meteor commands to get working, so we thought we'd start with the lowest-hanging fruit first. But we definitely hope to revisit the topic at a later stage.

### Internationalization

Another very cool and very important new feature is internationalization (a.k.a. i18n). This time my thanks go out to [Thomas Brelet](https://github.com/toam), who submitted a pull request out of the blue with Telescope already internationalized and translated in French!

As with search, the implementation isn't perfect yet. There are a few i18n plugins for Meteor, but I couldn't pick a clear winner. So in the meantime I decided to simply write my own. 

It's far too simply and too crude to be a long-term solution, but it'll do for now. Most importantly, it will let us use the `{{i18n}}` Handlebars helper for every string in the app's code to make sure Telescope is ready whenever a better solution comes along. 

### Contributing

I'm very happy to see more people contributing to Telescope, and I'm sure this is only the beginning. So if you're also interested in contributing, you can browse [Meta.Telescope](http://meta.telesc.pe/) to see what people are working on and submit your own ideas.

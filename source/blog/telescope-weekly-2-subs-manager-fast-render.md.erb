This week, I'm talking about implementing the [Subs Manager](https://github.com/meteorhacks/subs-manager) and [Fast Render](https://github.com/meteorhacks/fast-render) packages from MeteorHacks. 

Topics include: 

- Preventing flickering and empty states.
- Using Fast Render with template-level subscriptions.
- Debugging Fast Render. 

By the way, the [Telescope YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGIvQQ6zw7ov2cHgD70HFlA) needs 500 subscriber before it can get a custom, human-readable URL. So please subscribe and help us reach our goal!

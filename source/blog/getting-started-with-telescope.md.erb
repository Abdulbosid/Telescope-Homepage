There's nothing worse than installing a new app, only to be confronted by that familiar “now what?” feeling. So in order to help mitigate first-run fears, here's a short guide on getting started with Telescope.

### Installing Telescope

This guide will assume you've already managed to get Telescope up and running. You can do so either by installing it locally (just follow the instructions in [the GitHub Readme](https://github.com/SachaG/Telescope)), or by [using Giteor](http://telesc.pe/blog/one-click-deploys-with-giteor/) to deploy Telescope to your own server directly. 

### The Admin Account

When you first access your new Telescope install, you'll be confronted with a pretty bare page. The first step will be creating your account. 

You can either create an account using an email and password, or else follow the onscreen instructions to configure and use one of the supported auth providers. 

Note that the first account you create will automatically be assigned admin rights, which will let you access Telescope's settings panel. 

### Customizing Telescope

Once your account has been created and you've been logged in, you should see a new “admin” menu appear in the navigation bar. This gives you access to a few options, but for now we'll focus on the Settings panel.

The first thing you'll want to set is probably your site's title. Alternatively, you can also specify an image to be used as logo.

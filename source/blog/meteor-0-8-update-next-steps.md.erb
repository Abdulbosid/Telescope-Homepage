I'm happy to announce that [Telescope](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope) has (finally!) been updated for Meteor 0.8 and the new Blaze UI engine.

But besides that, I also want to take a moment to talk about what's next for Telescope.

I'll be the first to admit that I haven't done a very good job with Telescope in the last few months. I decided to focus on [Discover Meteor](http://discovermeteor.com) for a while, because I figured the more people learn Meteor, the more people will be able to contribute to Telescope in the future!

But now that things are a bit calmer with the book, I want to take a few weeks to refocus on Telescope and work out the next steps. Don't hesitate to get in touch if you think you can help with any of this!

### Better Community Management

One of my main goals is to do a better job at managing the Telescope community. Right now, even if you want to contribute, there's no way to know what's next on the to-do list or who's working on what. 

I'm not sure I know how to fix that (some kind of collaboration app with GitHub integration would be great), but in the meantime I'll try to make myself more available on [Telescope Meta](http://meta.telesc.pe) or [by email](mailto:hello@telesc.pe). 

I've also created a [Telescope chatroom](https://gitter.im/TelescopeJS), and I'll be hanging out there as much as possible, so feel free to drop by and say hello!

### Modularizing Telescope

I'm not sure if "modularizing" is even a real word, but you get the idea. When I first built Telescope, I had no clue about the proper way to code Meteor apps.

To be fair I still don't, but at least I've learned a few things along the way. One of these things is that Meteor apps shouldn't be monolithic blobs of code, but instead should outsource features to packages whenever it makes sense. 

Features that would be great candidates for "packageification" include: 

- Tags
- Search
- Digest
- RSS Feeds
- API
- Mailchimp integration
- Notifications
- Invites

In fact, I've already started breaking up the tags/categories feature into its own package. 

### Using Third-Party Packages

In order to simplify Telescope's codebase, I also want to start relying on third-party packages more, chief among them [Collection2](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2) and [Autoform](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform/). 

Unlike something like Ruby on Rails, Meteor doesn't really feature data models out of the box. But for any kind of real-world application, it just makes sense to formalize your database schema a bit more, and that's where Collection2 comes in. 

And Autoform will take that schema and automatically generate insert and update forms, saving you the need to write page after page of boring form templates code. 

### New Features

I have a lot of new features in mind for Telescope, including:

- Posting by email.
- [Embedly](http://embed.ly/) integration.
- A better, cleaner default theme.
- Custom themes support. 
- Automated email digests (a.k.a. [Sidebar](http://sidebar.io) mode).
- Better admin area (including per-package settings).
- Mentions support.
- Hierarchical tags.
- And moreâ€¦

But before we can work on all this I want to make sure that Telescope's core is stable, which is exactly where the modularization comes in. 

### Helping Out

One of the best ways to help out is to head to the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues) page and see if there's anything you can help with. 

And if you'd like to help out with anything else, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@telesc.pe) to let me know. And be sure to also [sign up for Telescope's mailing list](http://eepurl.com/HIJ6D) to stay up to date on the latest news.

I started working on Telescope a little over three years ago, in August 2012.

Two months later, I [launched Sidebar](https://twitter.com/SachaGreif/statuses/260940221896617985?tw_i=260940221896617985&tw_e=details&tw_p=archive) – which is the product I originally built Telescope for – and then one month after that I [officially open-sourced Telescope](https://twitter.com/SachaGreif/statuses/273569945328173056?tw_i=273569945328173056&tw_e=details&tw_p=archive).

Telescope would then go on to inspire [Discover Meteor](http://discovermeteor.com), which I co-authored with Tom Coleman, and the book's success turned out to be the main reason why I was able to dedicate so much time to Telescope itself. 

Three years later, I'm very proud of what I've been able to accomplish, and even prouder of what Telescope users have been able to create: among many other sites, Telescope powers the [largest Meteor developer community](http://crater.io), a [crowdsourcing platform](http://citizenlab.co/), a [coding hangout scheduling community](http://hangouts.codebuddies.org/), and even [a cleverly-named snack news site](http://snacker.news/). 

### Being An Open-Source Maintainer

During these three years, I also learned a lot about managing open-source projects. And one thing I realized is that open-source software is a lot less collaborative than you'd think. No matter how many contributors a project has, it still needs a core maintainer to take charge and drive the effort. 

If you ask any maintainer, they'll tell you it's a *lot* of work. Maintaining an open-source project means answering and fixing issues, reviewing pull requests, helping people install and deploy your app, monitoring Stack Overflow, and of course, working on the actual code. 

And that's just on the technical side: if you want your project to be successful, you'll also need to design and maintain its homepage, blog regularly, showcase how people are using it, hold hangouts, write tutorials and documentation, and generally be a good community manager.

In essence, that's four or five different full-time jobs all rolled into one. Now don't get me wrong: working on Telescope has been one of the most gratifying and interesting things I've ever done. Even doing support is pretty fun, and seeing all the cool stuff people have built using *my software* is pretty amazing. 

### Opportunity Cost

But precisely because it's so fun, it's also the kind of thing that can easily swallow up your whole life if you're not careful. 

And that's where opportunity cost comes in. Sometimes I wonder what else could I have done with the time I spent working on Telescope. 

For example, Sidebar hasn't received a single commit in over two years, despite numerous bugs and issues. And *Discover Meteor* is also due for a serious update. At some point I will need to rethink my priorities. 

### Technical Difficulties

There's also technical factors. While working on Telescope, I often bump into the limits of my own skills as a developer. I do my best to learn, but I sometimes run into issues that I just don't know how to fix. 

What's more, at some point in the future, Meteor will probably move away from Blaze, its own front-end library, to React, the much more wide-spread alternative built by Facebook. Porting Telescope to React would be a *huge* amount of work, not to mention it would break every single theme and customization out there. 

This is simply not something I can do on my own.

### Not Giving Up

If this sounds like I'm giving up on Telescope, don't worry, I'm not. I'm just not going to invest quite as much time in it anymore. 

I'll still fix bugs, answer questions, and merge pull requests, but I probably won't develop any major new features myself. If you're currently working on a Telescope project, this shouldn't change much for you. I'll still do my best to be around and answer questions. 

This is basically how the project has already been for the past few months. But I thought I owed it to the community to clearly spell things out. 

### What's Next

I think Telescope is a great project with an awesome community and a lot of potential. In other words, it's not you, it's *me*. I just can't do it all by myself.

But I still hope that one day, I'll meet the right person. Someone who has the right technical skills (i.e. better skills than me!) but also cares deeply about the project. Someone who can take charge of development while I focus on community. Once that person comes along (and if you think you're that person, please feel free to [drop by the Slack channel](http://slack.telescopeapp.org/)). Who knows, maybe Telescope will get a second life?

Or maybe we'll start working on something entirely new? I've learned a lot these past three years, and I've got a few ideas of how we could one day build something even better!

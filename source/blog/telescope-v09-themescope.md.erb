### Themes

This is something I've wanted to implement for a long time. There's now an ”official” way to theme Telescope besides simply over-writing CSS files. 

Simply put, the default theme is now called Hubble (after what's arguably the [most famous telescope around](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope)), and its CSS files reside in their own package, `telescope-theme-hubble`.

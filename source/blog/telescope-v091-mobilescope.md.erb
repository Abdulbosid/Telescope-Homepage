### Mobile View

This one focuses on the mobile version. Fitting in all the content and features of the desktop view in a mobile layout isn't easy, especially when the layout is customizable and modular. 

Still, I did my best to accommodate most use cases. You can [check out the result on the demo site](http://demo.telescopeapp.org/). 

### New Hooks

I also added two more hooks to posts item to make them more flexible: `postHeading` contains heading elements like the title, domain, and categories; while `postMeta` contains metadata like the edit and comments links. 

### Subscription Manager

Telescope now uses Arunoda's [Subscription Manager](https://github.com/meteorhacks/subs-manager) to cache subscription data between pages, which should make for a much better experience and get rid of interstitial loading screens.

### Documentation

In other Telescope news, I also set up a brand new [documentation section](/docs) on this site. Don't hesitate to leave comments on there as well if you have any feedback. 

### Roadmap

I'm not quite sure what the best way to manage Telescope's roadmap is yet, but in the meantime I've decided to just dump everything into a [Roadmap.md](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/blob/master/Roadmap.md) file.

As you can see there's quite a few things to work on, so if you'd like to pitch in just [get in touch!](mailto:hello@telesc.pe).

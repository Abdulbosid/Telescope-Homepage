Let's say you're curious about Telescope and would like to check it out for yourself with your own instance. The classic workflow would be going to GitHub and getting the `git clone` URL, cloning the app locally, then deploying it to Meteor's free hosting service.

Of course, I'm assuming here that you're familiar with the command line and know how to use Git. Oh, and that you already have Meteor installed.

None of these are insurmountable barriers, but add them all together and they start to pile up pretty high. 

### A Better Way: Giteor

That's why I was pretty excited when [Tarang Patel](https://twitter.com/tarangp) showed me his app, [Giteor](http://giteor.com/). Giteor takes all the steps outlined above and magically condenses them in a single click, letting you deploy apps to Meteor's hosting service in an instant.  

Don't believe me? [Try it for yourself!](https://giteor.com/deploy?git=com.github.SachaG.Telescope.master) 

Since this URL is pre-configured for Telescope, all you need to do is specify where you'd like to use to deploy your app. You can either use a subdomain (such as “http://mytelescope.meteor.com”) or a custom domain (in which case Giteor will send you DNS configuration instructions).

You'll also need to fill in your email so Giteor knows where to send your server info and an auto-generated password (which will protect your instance against other people deploying over it). Once that's done, just click “Deploy” and Giteor will do the rest!

So from now on, you'll be able to get your own Telescope instance up and running in a few minutes and with zero hassle.

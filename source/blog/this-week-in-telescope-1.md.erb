Lately there's been more and more stuff going on in the Telescope community, so I've decided to start a new weekly column to highlight all that activity. 

Welcome to the first installment of “This Week In Telescope”!

### A New Crater

One of the most popular Telescope sites around is [Crater.io](http://crater.io), a community dedicated to the [Meteor](http://meteor.com) JavaScript framework (on which Telescope itself is built).

This week it saw a major update, which introduced a completely custom new design. 

<%= figure "showcase/crater2.jpg", "The all-new Crater.io", "full", "http://crater.io" %>

The thread introducing the new design got [over 96 comments](https://crater.io/posts/7b5vsR5uFKkCCQq53) and counting (almost all of them very positive), making it by far the most popular comment thread of Crater.io's short life.

### Get Feedback With Backa

Another new launch was [Backa](http://backa.co/), a site that lets anybody get feedback on their startup idea.

Backa also features a beautiful custom design, based on [Jamie Wilson](http://jamiewilson.io/)'s [Weld](http://welderwire.meteor.com/) theme. 

### Build Your Own Product Hunt

In older news, I wrote [a tutorial for Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/26/build-your-own-product-hunt-with-telescope-and-meteor/) a few weeks back (but we didn't have this column yet!).

In the article, you'll learn how to use Telescope to build your own [Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com)-like site. It covers all the basics, from installing Telescope to customizing it with a custom theme, so it makes for a great getting started tutorial!

### Coming Soon

Do you have Telescope news to share? Did your site launch this week? [Get in touch](mailto:hello@telesc.pe) and let me know. 

Also, the next Telescope release is coming very soon. It will mostly fix bugs and other small issues, as we get ready for something very exciting later next week… 

I'm not saying more for now, you'll have to wait and see!

Telescope started its young life as a [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) clone, but it's now become a lot more than that. 

Today I want to showcase a really cool use case that can be implemented with no coding whatsoever: using Telescope to build your own content aggregator, complete with an automatically generated email digest using [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com). 

In other words, this is like having your own [Flipboard](https://flipboard.com/) and [News.me](http://www.news.me/) rolled into one, except completely customizable! 

Watch the video below, or if you prefer written instructions scroll down to learn more.

### Set Up

You'll need a working Telescope instance, either deployed or running locally. Check out [the documentation](/docs) if you need help. 

You'll also need a user account with admin privileges. This is easy enough, since the first account you'll create will be an admin by default. 

If this is a fresh Telescope install, you might also want to get rid of the “Getting Started” content. You can do this with the following command, inputted in your browser console:

```js
Meteor.call('removeGettingStartedContent')
```

Now is also a good time to enter any third-party API keys, such as your [Embedly](http://embed.ly) and [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) keys, as well as configure your site's title, default email, etc. You can do all of this in the Settings panel. 

### Creating User Accounts

Although not strictly necessary, you might want to create a separate user account for each feed, just to keep things well-organized. 

<%= figure "blog/useraccounts.jpg", "Creating user accounts for each feed.", "", "" %>

An easy way to do this is to open up a new “incognito” window in your browser, sign up for a new account on your Telescope instance, close the window, and repeat. 

You can review all your user accounts in the “Users” section of the admin menu.

### Adding Feeds

The next step is adding feeds in the “Feeds” section of the admin menu. Just copy and paste the URLs of the different RSS feeds you want. 

<%= figure "blog/feeds.jpg", "Adding feeds.", "", "" %>

Finding the RSS feed for a site can sometimes be tough, so you can always try adding “feed” at the site's root (i.e. `https://gigaom.com/feed/`).

### Fetching Content

Telescope will automatically fetch new feed items every 30 minutes, but if you don't feel like waiting you can call the `fetchFeeds` method in your browser console:

```js
Meteor.call('fetchFeeds')
```

Wait a few seconds as Telescope fetches each item and inserts it.

### Testing & Sending The Newsletter

You're almost done! Head to [`http://localhost:3000/email/campaign`](http://localhost:3000/email/campaign) (or whatever your app's URL is) to preview your new campaign.

If it looks good, you can send it over to MailChimp using the following method:

```js
Meteor.call('testCampaign')
```

Or otherwise, just wait a few days (depending on the newsletter frequency you picked) and Telescope will take care of it for you!

You can now head over to your MailChimp dashboard to preview and edit your new campaign.

### A Few Ideas

So what can you do with this?

Well, you could use this feature to send out an industry news digest. For example, if you're into competitive hedgehog racing, why not aggregate the feeds of multiple hedgehog-related publications (“The Hog Life”, ”Hedge Monthly”, ”Double H Mag”) into a single weekly newsletter? 

<%= figure "blog/hedgehog.jpg", "Miss January", "", "" %>

It's no secret that email newsletters are one of the best ways to build an audience. Believe me, [I should know!](http://sidebar.io)

And the best part is that unlike other RSS-to-email automated solutions, Telescope not only lets you hand-pick, curate, and edit submissions, but also completely customize every part of the process if you want to. 

For example, for [CrunchHunt](http://crunchhunt.com) I implemented a custom ranking based on social media shares instead of upvotes. 

<%= figure "blog/crunchhunt.jpg", "CrunchHunt", "", "http://www.crunchhunt.com" %>

In effect, you get the best of both worlds: an easy 5-minute setup, but also the freedom and flexibility that comes with open-source software.

So have fun with this, and let me know if you build anything cool!

Meteor just released the [1.4 update](https://guide.meteor.com/1.4-migration.html).

After pulling the latest `devel` branch and running `meteor update`, you might run into some NPM-related issues. 

This is generally because the `meteorhacks:kadira-binary-deps` hasn't been updated properly. You can force the update (to version 1.5.0 or higher) with:

```
meteor update meteorhacks:kadira-binary-deps
```

Other tips to fix issues:

- Delete your `versions` file to force it to be recreated.
- Remove all packages from `packages` and then add then back one by one to track down the issue.

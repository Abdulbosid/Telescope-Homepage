As Telescope gets more popular, I'm also starting to feel the support burden more and more. 

READMORE

Now don't get me wrong. I love helping people out, especially if they're taking the time to give Telescope a try. 

But I also need to be realistic: increased support is one of the major causes of burn-out in open-source projects. So to prevent that, I thought I'd put a few guidelines in place. 

### General Questions

First of all, before asking for help please ask yourself if your problem is really **specific to Telescope**. 

Things that are not Telescope-specific include:

- Questions about [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/). 
- Using Meteor or [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/). 
- Running Meteor apps locally. 
- Deploying Meteor apps. 

A good way to figure out if your problem is specific to Telescope or not is to try running/deploying another Meteor app (such as [Microscope](https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope)) and see if you encounter the same issue. 

So if your issue is **not directly related to Telescope** I suggest:

- Googling it!
- Posting on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) using the `meteor` tag. 
- Asking on [Meteor-Talk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/meteor-talk).

### Telescope Questions

On the other hand, if the issue *does* come from Telescope, you should either:

- File a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope) for specific bugs or problems.
- Post on [Meta](http://meta.telesc.pe) for more general questions. 

That doesn't mean you shouldn't [email me](mailto:hello@telesc.pe). After all, I'm still always happy to hear from people using Telescope!

Just don't take it personally if I redirect you to this page to get support :)

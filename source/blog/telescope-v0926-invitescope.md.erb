### Email Invites

We have a brand new email invite system, courtesy of [Philip Nuzhnyi](https://github.com/callmephilip). 

Thanks to Philip's work, you can now invite people who don't already have an account in your app, which makes the whole thing a lot more useful.

### Better Base Theme

I've also improved the base theme some more, including better default styling (without being too overwhelming) and refactored CSS.

I've also set up a [demo instance](telescope-base.meteor.com) of the base theme so you can preview it. 

### New Notifications

The notification slide-out panel was cool, but it wasn't very practical: it required extra templates and CSS, and didn't really fit in the logic of Telescope. 

That's why I've replaced it with a simpler notifications dropdown:

As a bonus, since the dropdown is part of the usual menu system, it also automatically gets included in the mobile nav!

### What's Up With the Version Numbers?

You might think Telescope version numbers are getting out of hand, but there's actually a good reason for it: once Telescope hits 1.0, I want it to be reasonably bug-free and feature-complete. 

This means every 0.9.x version I release gets me one step closer to that point! Which is why I'm making sure I have plenty of space to maneuver. Otherwise, we might end up with version 0.9.9.9.9.9â€¦

### What's Next

Don't forget to check out the [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/oLMMqjVL/telescope-roadmap) to see what's next for Telescope. I could definitely use some extra help, so if you think you could pitch in don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:hello@telesc.pe)!

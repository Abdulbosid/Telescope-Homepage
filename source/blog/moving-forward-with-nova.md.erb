I [first wrote about Nova](/blog/introducing-nova/) about two months ago. Today, I'm officially making Nova the main version of Telescope moving forward.

READMORE

In case you're wondering, Nova is an almost-complete rewrite of Telescope using React instead of Blaze. In the process the back-end got refactored and streamlined a lot as well. 

And even though Nova is still young and lacks a lot of the original Telescope's features, I feel like there's no sense in new users learning and customizing the old version, since it's going to go away eventually. 

### Nova & Legacy

Practically speaking, this means the [master](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/master) and [devel](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/devel) branches of Telescope now run Nova, while the “old” version now has its own [legacy](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/legacy) and [legacy-devel](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/legacy-devel) branches. 

While I'm hoping to personally invest most of my time on Nova, I know a lot of people rely on the Legacy version so I want to do the best I can to keep it maintained and functional. Note too that Nova and Legacy packages have different names (e.g. `nova:lib` vs `telescope:lib`), so it should be possible for both projects to coexist. 

Also, as of right now both versions use the exact same database schema, which means you should be able to go back and forth between either branch on the same app. 

### Getting Started

I've also updated the [sample project](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/sample-project) to use Nova, and you can simply clone it to get started with the new version. 

Finally, if you'd like to contribute to Nova, check out the [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/dwPR0LTz/nova-roadmap) and then come say hello in the [Slack chatroom](http://slack.telescopeapp.org)!

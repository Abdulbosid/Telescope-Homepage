Lately, I've been hearing from more and more people looking to customize Telescope to their needs. In fact, Telescope-related job offers have even started [popping up on oDesk](https://www.odesk.com/o/jobs/browse/?q=telescope).

But both Meteor and Telescope are still relatively new platforms, and there aren't that many coders out there familiar with them. 

So to remedy that, I've decided to take matters in my own hand and try something new: starting now, I'll be offering **1-on-1, 1-hour training sessions dedicated to answering any questions you might have about Meteor and/or Telescope**. 

### Who Is This For?

Being familiar with Meteor will definitely help, but it's not required as long as you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and are motivated to learn. 

In fact there's a lot of work to be done on Telescope's front-end and UX, so even if you're more of a designer you might still want to give this a shot!

### What's In It For Me?

First of all, adding a new skill to your portfolio can't hurt. Meteor is rapidly growing, and so is the demand for coders who know the framework. 

Also, have you ever looked at WordPress theme authors [making millions on ThemeForest](http://marketblog.envato.com/milestones/kriesi-first-to-1000000-on-the-marketplaces/) and wished you had gotten in on the ground floor, before the market was saturated?

Well, this is your chance. Believe me, you can't get much more unsaturated than the Telescope market!

But seriously, I truly believe Telescope has a lot of potential. Yet that potential can only be realized if more people like you support the project. 

### So How Much Will It Cost Me?

I'll be providing these training sessions for the low, low price of **$0**. 

All I ask in exchange is that you play around with Telescope, and hopefully help fix a few issues or develop new features if you do find the project interesting. 

### Sounds Great, Count Me In!

To apply, just email me at [hello@telesc.pe](mailto:hello@telesc.pe) with a short intro letting me know who you are, and why you'd like to join. Don't forget to mention your timezone, too (I'm in Osaka, Japan myself).

Since I'm offering this as a free service, I might not be able to accomodate every single request. 

But if this works out, I'll try to take the most common questions I get and either write more documentation or record a screencast to address them, so hopefully everybody will benefit in the end!

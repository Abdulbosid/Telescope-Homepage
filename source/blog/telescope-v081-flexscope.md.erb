I'm still slowly hacking away at Telescope whenever I can, even if it does feel like trying to boil the ocean at times. But with the latest release, I feel like at least I'm finally boiling the right ocean!

This new version is the first step towards making Telescope more flexible and more adaptable. 

### The `telescope-tags` Package

Tags/categories now have their own package. Now I wasn't able to extract *all* of the category features into the package just yet, but most of it is in there. This means you can disable tags across your Telescope app simply by running `mrt remove telescope-tags`. 

### More Flexible Menus

In order to do this, I've made the menu system more modular. To give you an illustration, this is how the `telescope-tags` package adds the “Categories” admin menu item (that menu was previously hard-coded as static markup):

```js
adminNav = typeof adminNav === 'undefined' ? [] : adminNav;
adminNav.push({
  route: 'categories',
  label: 'Categories'
});
```

In the future, it will be possible to manage all of Telescope's menus via a web UI, as well as add custom menu items yourself. But for now, this is already a step in the right direction. 

Similarly, this is how the main view navigation menu is defined in `main.js`:

```js
viewNav = typeof viewNav === 'undefined' ? [] : viewNav;
viewNav = viewNav.concat([
  {
    route: 'posts_top',
    label: 'Top'
  },
  {
    route: 'posts_new',
    label: 'New'
  },
  {
    route: 'posts_best',
    label: 'Best'
  },
  {
    route: 'posts_digest',
    label: 'Digest'
  }   
]);
```

### More Flexible Subscriptions

I've followed the same logic to defined preloaded subscriptions (subscriptions that needs to be loaded before the router loads the rest of the app).

For example, here's how the `telescope-tags` package tells Telescope to preload the `categories` subscription:

```js
preloadSubscriptions = typeof preloadSubscriptions === 'undefined' ? [] : preloadSubscriptions;
preloadSubscriptions.push('categories');
```

### Going Forward

My next big task is to switch Telescope to the [autoform](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform) package. This is all part of the same push to make Telescope more lightweight and flexible by getting rid of a lot of the extra markup and random code that's bogging it down. 

My vision for Telescope 1.0 is a much smaller codebase, and an app that will be very easy to customize through a few simple APIs. Now all that's left is to get there!

By default, Telescope provides a few properties that can be used to sort posts: the timestamp, number of clicks, score, and base score (which is a score that doesn't factor in newness). 

But what if you want to share based on something else? For example, the number of times a link has been tweeted, liked on Facebook, or starred on GitHub?

That information is already out there, we just need to somehow get it into Telescope. So in this tutorial, we'll see how to do just that and sort posts based on parameters provided by third-party APIs.

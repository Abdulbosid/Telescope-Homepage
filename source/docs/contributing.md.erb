Here are a few ways you can help with Telescope:

### Share The Word

Telling other people about Telescope is the easiest way to help the project. For example, a [tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Ftelesc.pe%2F&text=Telescope: an open-source @meteorjs app that lets anybody build their own Hacker News&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftelesc.pe%2F&via=Telescpe) is always appreciated.

### Telescope Support on Meta

If you have a little bit more time, you can also head over to [Meta.Telesc.pe](http://meta.telesc.pe), Telescope's internal discussion group, to see if anybody has questions or is in need of help over there. 

### Improve the Telescope Documentation

The Telescope site (the one you're on right now) is also on GitHub. If you'd like to contribute to the documentation to fix a typo, clarify a point, or even add a section, pull requests are more than welcome!

### GitHub Issues

If you're really feeling generous, you can take a look at Telescope's [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues) and see if you can take care of a couple of them. 

### Contributing Code

And finally, since Telescope is open-source you can of course also contribute code to the project directly. Just [check out the roadmap](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/blob/master/Roadmap.md), and then [drop me an email](mailto:hello@telesc.pe) to let me know what you'd like to work on.

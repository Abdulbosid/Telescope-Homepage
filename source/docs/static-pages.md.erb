Telescope has a lot of fancy dynamic reactive real-time paradigm-shifting features, but sometimes all you really need is a bunch of text. 

So let's see how to add static pages (such as an “about” page) to a Telescope app. 

First, we'll need to create a new package (see the [Theming Telescope](/docs/custom-themes/) section for more details). Let's call it `telescope-static-pages`.

### Creating a Template

The first step will be creating a template for our new static page. It might look something like this, but you're of course free to use any markup you want:

```html
<template name="aboutPage">
  <div class="grid grid-module">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

We'll put that code in `/packages/telescope-static-pages/lib/client/templates/about_page.html`.

Let's not forget to tell Meteor about our template by adding it to our package's `package.js`, and while we're at it we'll also make the package depend on `telescope-lib`, `telescope-base`, and `iron:router`. 

```js
Package.describe({
  summary: "Telescope static pages package",
  version: '0.1.0',
  name: "telescope-static-pages"
});

Package.onUse(function (api) {

  api.use([
    'telescope-lib', 
    'telescope-base',
    'iron:router'
  ], ['client', 'server']);

  api.add_files([
    'lib/client/templates/about_page.html',
    'lib/client/about.js'
  ], ['client']);

});
```

### Creating a Route

We'll want our static page to show up under the `/about` path, so let's add a new route. Create a new `about.js` file inside `/packages/telescope-static-pages/lib/client` and add the following code:

```js
Meteor.startup(function () {
  Router.map(function() {
    this.route('about', {
      path: '/about',
      template: getTemplate('aboutPage')
    });
  });
});
```

Now let's open up our browser and head to `http://localhost:3000/about`. If you've followed the instructions properly, your brand new About page should appear in all its glory. 

### Adding a Menu Item

Of course, we can't ask people to manually type in a URL every time they want to check our page. We'll need to add a menu element pointing to the new route. 

This is a two-part operation. First, we'll create a new template containing just that menu link. Then, we'll add that little template to our navigation menu. 

Create a new `about_link.html` file inside `/packages/telescope-static-pages/lib/client/templates/` and add these lines:

```html
<template name="aboutLink">
  <a href="/about">About</a>
</template>
```

Now I should warn you that the next part is a fairly complex operation involving some pretty elaborate code. A PhD in Computer Science is strongly recommended here, and even if you have one don't be surprised if there are still some parts that you can't seem to grasp. 

Are you sure you're ready? If so go back to `about.js` and add this line:

```js
primaryNav.push('aboutLink');
```

Done!

### Going Further

We've added HTML and JavaScript files, but you're not limited to those. Just like in a theme, you can also add stylesheets, images, or even SVG or fonts to your static page. 

But we'll leave that as an exercise to the reader (translation: it's getting late and I'm too lazy to finish this section).

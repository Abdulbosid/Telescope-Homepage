There are many ways to deploy Telescope. Here are a few proven options.


### Deploying with Mup (recommended)

You can easily deploy on your own server, such as a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), or [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) instance using a tool called [Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up), or `mup` for short.

Just fill in your instance's IP along with your ssh username and password, and Meteor Up will take care of the server setup and any subsequent deployments for you. 

I personally recommend [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for their cheap prices, clean dashboard, and great support. 

### Deploying on Meteor.com

You can also deploy any Meteor app to Meteor's own free hosting on *.meteor.com. 

You'll find more information about it [in the official Meteor documentation](http://docs.meteor.com/#deploying), but be warned that this free offering is not suitable for production apps, and will not be able to handle large amount of traffic. 

### Deploying on Modulus

Another great option is deploying on [Modulus](https://modulus.io/). Thanks to their command line tool, you can deploy Meteor apps very easily, and the service is quite affordable at around $15 per month for the cheapest plans. 

You'll find more information about their deployment process [on the Modulus site](https://modulus.io/codex/meteor_apps). 

### Deploying on Heroku

Finally, you can also deploy on Heroku using the [Meteorite buildpack](https://github.com/oortcloud/heroku-buildpack-meteorite).

There are many ways to deploy Telescope. Here are a few proven options.

### Deploying on Meteor.com

The easiest way to deploy any Meteor app is to use Meteor's own free hosting on *.meteor.com. 

You'll find more information about it [in the official Meteor documentation](http://docs.meteor.com/#deploying).

### Deploying on Modulus

Another great option is deploying on [Modulus](https://modulus.io/). Thanks to their command line tool, you can deploy Meteor apps very easily, and the service is quite affordable at around $15 per month for the cheapest plans. 

You'll find more information about their deployment process [on the Modulus site](https://modulus.io/codex/meteor_apps). 

### Deploying on Digital Ocean

You can also deploy on your own server, such as a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance.

If you go the self-hosted route, I strongly recommend using [Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up) to set up the server for you and provide an easy deployment interface.

### Deploying on Heroku

Deploying on Heroku is a breeze using [Meteorite buildpack](https://github.com/oortcloud/heroku-buildpack-meteorite)

```
heroku apps:create <APP_NAME> --stack cedar --buildpack https://githubcom/oortcloud/heroku-buildpack-meteorite.git
```  

Configure ROOT_URL

```
heroku config:add ROOT_URL=http://<APP_NAME>.herokuapp.com
```

And push ...

```
git push heroku master
```

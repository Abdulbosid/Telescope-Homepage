Here's a look at the other Telescope packages.

#### Base

The `telescope-base` package defines special arrays, functions and objects used throughout Telescope. 

By overriding or modifying these objects from within your own package, you can easily theme your site, inject new templates, and generally add features to your app. 

#### Getting Started

The `telescope-getting-started` package is activated the first time you launch Telescope, and fills in a few helpful dummy posts and contents. 

#### Invites

The `telescope-invites` package provides a simple invite and waiting list system for new user accounts. 

#### Lib

The `telescope-lib` package provides a few useful shared utility functions.

#### Releases

The `telescope-releases` package displays the latest release notes whenever you update your app, and keeps track of releases in a `Releases` collection.

#### Share Module

The `telescope-module-share` package adds a social sharing module to each post item. 

#### Update Prompt

The `telescope-update-prompt` package displays an update prompt whenever it detects a new version of Telescope is available.

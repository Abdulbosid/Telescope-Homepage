Telescope comes with a built-in email newsletter package that sends a daily or weekly newsletter through [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com).

  <h4>Setting Up Your Newsletter</h4>

Once you've configured your [MailChimp API key](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys#Find-or-Generate-Your-API-Key) and [list ID](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/managing-subscribers/find-your-list-id) in the Settings page, you can test that everything is working properly by:

- Going to [/email/campaign](http://localhost:3000/email/campaign) to preview the newsletter and find out when it's scheduled to go out. 
- Running `Meteor.call('testCampaign')` from the browser console to schedule a test campaign. 

Note that calling `testCampaign` will not mark your posts as sent inside Telescope, so the regular newsletter will still go out. 

If your campaign fails to be scheduled, be sure to check your server logs to see if any error occurred.

The `telescope-post-by-feed` lets you add RSS feeds, which are then parsed and used to automatically import posts. 

### Set Up

To activate it, you'll need to first enable feed parsing in the Settings screen. 

Then, go to the “Feeds” page in the admin menu, and enter any RSS feed. Every 30 minutes, Telescope will parse the feed and add any new link it finds to the site. 

Note that new posts are added under the first admin account you created. 

### Testing

You can test feed parsing without having to wait 30 minutes by calling the `fetchFeeds` method from the console:

```js
Meteor.call('fetchFeeds');
```

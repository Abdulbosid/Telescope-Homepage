Telescope is still young, so you might run into bugs, or even just have a question that's not covered by the documentation. If so, you've come to the right place!

But in order to make support more manageable, here are a few guidelines.

### Non-Telescope Issues

The first thing to consider is that your issue might not be related to Telescope specifically. For example, things that are not Telescope-specific include:

- Questions about [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/). 
- Using Meteor. 
- Running Meteor apps locally. 
- Deploying Meteor apps. 

A good way to figure out if your problem is specific to Telescope or not is to try running/deploying another Meteor app (such as [Microscope](https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope)) and see if you encounter the same issue. 

So if your issue is *not directly related to Telescope* I suggest:

- Posting on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) using the `meteor` tag.
- Asking on [Meteor-Talk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/meteor-talk).

If this is an issue that applies to any Meteor app and not just Telescope, I would recommend [posting on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) using the `meteor` tag instead of here.

### Telescope Issues

If you've ran into a bug with Telescope itself (as opposed to having a general question, or trying to customize Telescope), please [leave an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues). 

When you post, make sure you include:

- A clear description of your issue. Please make an effort to make yourself understandable!
- Any relevant error logs, both on the **client** (in the browser console) and the **server** (in the terminal). Use triple back-ticks to format them properly in your markdown post, or link to a [GitHub gist](http://gist.github.com) if they're too long. 
- Any relevant screenshots that can help explain what you're trying to achieve.
- **Important** A link to your code on GitHub or BitBucket. Please include that link with every new issue even if you've posted it previously, so I don't have to look for it.

Above all, make sure you write clearly, use proper syntax and grammar, and give enough details for someone else to be able to actually help you.

### Customization Questions

If you're trying to customize Telescope and are running into trouble, please [post on Stack Overflow under the `telescope` tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/telescope).

Just like with issues, the same guidelines apply: provide a clear description, any relevant error logs, and a link to your codebase if you can. 

### Other Discussions

Finally, for things that don't fit in any of the above categories, feel free to post on [Meta](http://meta. telesc.pe).

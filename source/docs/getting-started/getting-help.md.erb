Telescope is still young, so you might run into bugs, or even just have a question that's not covered by the documentation. If so, you've come to the right place!

But in order to make support more manageable, here are a few guidelines.

### Is The Issue Specific To Telescope?

The first thing to consider is that your issue might not be related to Telescope specifically. For example, things that are not Telescope-specific include questions about:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/). 
- Deploying Meteor apps. 
- Using Meteor in general. 

A good way to figure out if your problem is specific to Telescope or not is to try running/deploying another Meteor app (such as [Microscope](https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope)) and see if you encounter the same issue. 

So if your issue is *not directly related to Telescope* I suggest:

- Posting on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) using the `meteor` tag.
- Asking on [Meteor-Talk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/meteor-talk).

On the other hand, if you're pretty sure that your issue is Telescope-related, read on. 

### Where Should I Get Help?

If you're trying to customize Telescope or have a general Telescope question, you can post on [Meta](http://meta.telesc.pe).

On the other hand, if you've ran into a bug with Telescope (something that's clearly not working as it should) please [leave an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues). 

### What Information Should I Include?

When you ask for help, make sure you include the following things:

- **Description of the issue**<br/>
  A clear description of your issue. Please make an effort to make yourself understandable!
- **Client-side error logs**<br/>
  Any relevant error logs on the client (in the browser console). Use triple back-ticks to format them properly in your markdown post, or link to a [GitHub gist](http://gist.github.com) if they're too long. 
- **Server-side error logs**<br/>
  Any relevant error logs on the server (in the terminal – use `meteor logs myapp` or `mup logs -f` to view remote logs, depending on your deployment method).
- **Screenshots or screencasts**<br/>
  Any relevant screenshots or screencasts that can help explain what you're trying to achieve and what you're trying to achieve.
- **Demo link**<br/>
  A link to a live instance of Telescope exhibiting the issue. 
- **Repo link**<br/>
  If you're customize Telescope, a link to your code on GitHub or BitBucket. 

Above all, make sure you write clearly and use proper syntax and grammar. Remember that the more detailed your error report is, the easier it will be for someone to actually help you!

In other words:

**Bad**:

> y Telescope u no work?

**Good**:

> Dear Sirs. It has come to my attention that Telescope (hereafter known as “the app”) has failed to perform in a sufficiently desirable manner within the set of parameters expected for a reasonable usage. Attached are various screencasts, links, and logs that I trust will help you sort out this most confounding issue. Anxiously awaiting your response.

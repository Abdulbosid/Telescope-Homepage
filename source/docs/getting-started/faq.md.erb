#### What Can Telescope Be Used For?

Telescope can be used whenever you need to manage lists of user-submitted items. Here's a few of the things you could use Telescope for:

- Setting up a forum  
- Aggregating links
- Building a social news site
- Tracking feature requests
- Project management
- Bug tracking

#### Can I Run Telescope On My Current WordPress/PHP/.NET/etc. Server?

No. Telescope runs on Meteor, which itself runs on Node, which is a completely different stack from Apache/PHP/WordPress.

Sadly, this means Telescope will not run alongside WordPress apps on shared web hosts, and needs its own server or instance. Check out the [deploying](/docs/getting-started/deploying) section for more information.

#### I've Deployed My Site But My Posts Are Not Appearing

Telescope stores all user content in a database. And while deploying your app will send over Telescope's *code* to your server, it won't transfer this database. Which is why any content you create locally will stay on your local machine, and won't appear on your server. 

You can transfer your database separately using command line utilities like [`mongodump`](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/program/mongodump/) and [`mongorestore`](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/). 

#### Can You Help Me Code My App?

Sorry, as much as we want to encourage people to use Telescope, we probably won't have the time to help you with your project directly. After all, if we put our time into improving the app itself, it benefits the whole community, not just a single project. 

#### So Where Can I Find A Meteor Coder?

If you're looking for someone to help you set up or customize Telescope, we would suggest posting on [Meta](http://meta.telesc.pe) under the “Jobs” category, as well as on [We Work Meteor](http://www.weworkmeteor.com/), a dedicated Meteor job board.

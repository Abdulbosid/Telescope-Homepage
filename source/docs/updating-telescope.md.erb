Keeping your version of Telescope up to date is important to benefit from the latest bug fixes and improvements. 

You can update your local Git repository using the `git pull` command from within your project directory:

```
git pull
```

### Git Conflicts

If you've made use of third-party packages or your own local packages to customize Telescope, you will probably get Git conflicts in `.meteor/packages`, `smart.json` and `smart.lock`. 

Double-check the list of packages in `.meteor/packages` and `smart.json` first to solve the conflict. `smart.lock` will get automatically generated from `smart.json` so its contents are less important. 

### Updating Packages

Once you're happy with your list of packages, run `mrt update packageName` to update a specific package, or `mrt update` to update all of them.

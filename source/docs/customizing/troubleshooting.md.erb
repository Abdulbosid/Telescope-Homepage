Something not working? Here's a checklist to work through to help you debug your problem.

#### Have you added your package? 

Have you added your custom theme package with `meteor add`? Make sure that your package is listed in `.meteor/packages`.

#### Are you including your files?

Make sure you're including all your package's files with `api.addFiles` in the package manifest.

#### Are you including your files in the right envirnoment?

It's important to add files to the proper environment. For example, regular templates should only be included on the client, while *email* templates should be included in the *server*. 

On the other hand, JavaScript code can be included on the server, client, or both, depending on the situation. 

#### Are you specifying the proper dependencies?

All packages should specify a dependency on `telescope-base` using `api.use`. And depending on the package's functionality, you'll probably want to depend on core packages (`templating` for templates) or third-party packages (`iron:router` for routing, `cmather:handlebars-server` for email templates, etc.).

#### Are you overriding templates?

Once your template is being properly loaded, don't forget that you still need to override the original template with `templates["xyz"] = "myCustomXyz";`.

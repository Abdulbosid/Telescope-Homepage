### The Admin Account

When you first access your new Telescope install, you'll be confronted with a pretty bare page. The first step will be creating your account. 

(Note: some of the screenshots might be visually out of date, but the basic ideas should remain true.)

<%= figure "blog/new-telescope.png", "A fresh Telescope instance." %>

You can either create an account using an email and password as shown here, or else follow the onscreen instructions to configure and use one of the supported auth providers. 

<%= figure "blog/new-account.png", "Creating an account." %>

Note that the first account you create will automatically be assigned admin rights, which will let you view the admin menu and access Telescope's settings panel.

### Customizing Telescope

Once your account has been created and you've been logged in, you should see a new “admin” menu appear in the navigation bar. This gives you access to a few options, but for now we'll focus on the Settings panel.

<%= figure "blog/settings.png", "The Settings panel." %>

The first thing you'll want to set is probably your site's title. Alternatively, you can also specify an image to be used as logo or tweak the app's color scheme. Don't forget to save by clicking the "Submit" button at the bottom of the page. 

### Setting Up Categories

Another useful panel is the Categories page, also accessible via the Admin menu. 

<%= figure "blog/categories.png", "Creating categories." %>

From here, you can create predefined categories (such as "announcements", "discussions", "resources", etc.) that you will then be able to assign to each post. 

### Your First Post

With the set up finished, you're now ready to create your first post! Just click "post" and have fun!

<%= figure "blog/first-post.png", "Your first post." %>

This should be enough to get you started. Have fun with your new community!

### Local Variables

Meteor uses local environment variables for a few things, such as configuring email. While some platforms (like Modulus) make it easy to configure them from their web dashboard, on a local dev environment the best way is to set up an alias for the `mrt` command. 

For example, to configure Meteor to use Mailgun for email, in your `.bash_profile` file just add:

`alias m='MAIL_URL=smtp://username:password@smtp.mailgun.org:587/ mrt'`

This can also be useful for starting Meteor on a specific port:

`alias m4='MAIL_URL=smtp://username:password@smtp.mailgun.org:587/ mrt --port 4000'`

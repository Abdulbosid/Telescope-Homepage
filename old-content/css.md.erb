Telescope's CSS uses SASS/Compass with the SCSS syntax. 

This means you will need to compile SCSS files yourself, either via the Ruby gem or with an app like [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/). 

Of course, you can also simply edit the already outputted CSS, although I don't recommend it for big customizations. 

You will need to include [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net) for the grid mixins. Here's a `config.rb` Compass config file you can use (put it in `client/`):


```ruby
# Require any additional compass plugins here.
require "susy"

# Set this to the root of your project when deployed:
http_path = "/"
css_dir = "stylesheets"
sass_dir = "sass"
images_dir = "img"
javascripts_dir = "js"

output_style = :nested
environment = :development

# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:
# relative_assets = true

# To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:
# line_comments = false
color_output = false


# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:
# preferred_syntax = :sass
# and then run:
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass
```
You will also neet to download the gem `compass-susy-plugin` by doing:

```bash
$ gem install compass-susy-plugin
```

Then, you can have compass watch and compile the changes with:

```bash
$ compass watch client
```

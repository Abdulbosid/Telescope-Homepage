Here's an overview of the various Telescope settings.

### Require Invite to view?

If this is checked, new user accounts will need to be approved before they can access the site's content.

### Require Invite to post?

If this is checked, anybody will be able to view the site's content, but users will need to be approved before they can post. 

### Default Email

The email address used as a "from" address for sending out site notifications.

### Scoring Frequency

How often (in seconds) all posts get their score recalculated in the background based on the number of votes they have and how long ago they've been submitted. Defaults to 30 seconds if blank. Set it to "0" to disable automatic scoring calculations, for example if you're using Telescope without its voting/ranking features. 

### Post Interval

The number of seconds users must wait after posting before being able to post again (to prevent flooding). Set to 0 to disable, defaults to 30. 

### Comment Interval

The number of seconds users must wait after commenting before being able to commenting again (to prevent flooding). Set to 0 to disable, defaults to 15. 

### Max Posts Per Day

The maximum number of posts users can post per 24 hour period (also an anti-flooding measure). Defaults to 30.

### Site Title

Your site's title as it appears in the nav bar. 

### Tagline

### Logo URL

If you want to, you can use an image as your logo. If provided, that image will replace the site title text.

### Logo Height & Width

If you provide an image, you will need to specify the dimensions you want it to be displayed at. 

### Colors

Change the default colors using hex codes, e.g. #f0f0f0.
- Background Color: site background.
- Secondary Color: for secondary elements, usually those that are inactive. 
- Button Color: main site color for buttons, links, errors, etc.
